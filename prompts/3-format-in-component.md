Instead of ChatWindow, create an input field where I can paste the case study content in markdown format.

Make a POST request to the `api/chat/structured_output` endpoint with the case study content as the payload.

Render the response in the CaseStudyReport component.

Match the response structure of the returned format to the CaseStudyReport Component.
